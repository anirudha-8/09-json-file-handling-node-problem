# 🌟 Problem 9: JSON File Handling 🌟  

Welcome to the ninth challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 This time, we will work with **JSON files**, a crucial skill for managing data in Node.js applications. Let’s dive into reading, modifying, and writing JSON files seamlessly! 💻  

---  

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Write a Node.js script that:  

1. Reads the content of a JSON file.  
2. Modifies a specific part of the data.  
3. Writes the modified content back to the file.  

---  

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Learn how to use Node.js’s `fs` module to work with JSON files.  
- Understand how to parse and stringify JSON data.  
- Gain hands-on experience in handling file I/O operations.  

---  

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
09-json-file-handling-node-problem/  
├── data.json          # The JSON file to be read and modified  
├── jsonHandler.js     # The script for handling JSON operations  
├── README.md          # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json       # Project configuration file  
```

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you’ve completed the basics, try adding:

- Dynamic Updates: Allow users to specify the key-value pair to modify via command-line arguments.

- Error Handling: Handle cases where the JSON file is invalid or the file path is incorrect.

- Backup File Creation: Create a backup of the original file before modifying it.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to read and write JSON files in Node.js.

- Parsing JSON strings into JavaScript objects and vice versa.

- Handling file operations with error management for robustness.
